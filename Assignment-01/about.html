        <p>The Cargills philosophy has always been focused on community development and contributing towards 
            a better Sri Lanka. 
            This is why we say CSR is our business. From serving a few to serving the nation, 
            Cargills has come a long way. By continuing to build markets for farming communities and 
            creating opportunities for local entrepreneurs, Cargills has continued to invest in the community.
            This is because we believe in the future potential of Sri Lanka.
        </p>
        <p>With a trusted heritage of over 175 years,
             the Cargills Group is built on the principles of reducing the cost of living, 
             enhancing youth skills, and bridging regional disparities.
            Our commitment to developing a sustainable and socially responsible business has made us one of the
            leading 
              consumer goods companies in the country. Spread across retail, food manufacturing, restaurants, 
              and banking,
               Cargills touches the lives of millions of Sri Lankans every day, 
            from customers to farmers to suppliers and the wider community</p>
